## 🎨 Project Overview

**Lumière** is a high-fidelity concept landing page built to demonstrate advanced **UI Design** and **Frontend Architecture** skills. 

The primary goal of this project was to move beyond standard web layouts and create an immersive, "premium" digital experience. It focuses heavily on atmosphere, micro-interactions, and fluid motion to evoke the feeling of a high-end fine dining establishment.

This repository serves as a portfolio piece showcasing:
- **Atmospheric UI**: Usage of deep color palettes (`#0f291e`), subtle gradients, and glassmorphism to create depth.
- **Advanced Animations**: Complex scroll-triggered reveals and staggered entrance effects using **Framer Motion**.
- **Micro-Interactions**: Custom "shiny" button effects, reactive hover states, and smooth transitions that enhance user engagement.
- **Component Architecture**: Clean, reusable React components styled with the flexible **Tailwind CSS v4** engine.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Framework**: [React 18](https://react.dev/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) (using CSS variables and `@theme`)
- **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Icons**: Custom SVG implementation & Line Awesome
- **Assets**: AI-generated imagery for concept visualization
